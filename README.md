### Another Portfolio

This is a copy of a simple portfolio application that I created to learn working with **React JS**.
I created it with the option of three languages: *English, German, Italian*.

You can see the deployed project at http://piosaija.eu

I did it with **JavaScript**, **HTML** and **CSS**.

Dependencies: **React Router Dom**.

Data in the website are fetched from *Json* files. So you can change the content of the website just changing the Json files content and images that are stored in the **public/images** folder.

For the contant page I used a *third party service* and *Google reCAPTCHA*. If you want to use them you must subscribe to get your personal code.

Feel free to fork it and change it.

To work on it you need node.js installed in your machine. Commands: **npm install** for modules and **npm start** for browser preview.
